# Spam Detector Online Using Machine Learning

This is my first web application using streamlit. It aims at detecting whether or not your email might be considered as spam or not, based on various metrics.
In addition, the app includes the steps of a solid machine learnng project that enabled us to build a spam detector.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:


- streamlit
- bokeh
- joblib
- pandas
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- bkharts
- regex
